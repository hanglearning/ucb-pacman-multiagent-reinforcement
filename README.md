## Introduction

This repository is a final project for CISC889 Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL). Base on the video game Mr. Pac-Man framework from CS188 UCB, we are going to design a strategy to apply multiple Pacman agents to eat pellets in the maze. To get a higher score, Pacman should eat all pellets as quickly as possible while avoid being eaten by the ghosts.

## Timeline

- [x] (2 weeks) implement **SARSA** on _1 ghosts_ and _1 pacman_;
- [x] (1 weeks) extend to _1 ghosts_ and _2 pacmans_; (ended up to several pacmans)
- [x] (3 weeks) figure out and implement proper **MARL algorithm** to replace _SARSA_; (ended up adding a DQN agent)
